## About The Project

<h3> <strong> Synopsis </strong> </h3>

<div>
<p> Four Sided learning is a game designed for kids, 
that helps establish core fundaments in subjects like math, and science. 
Students will work through levels where they must be creative in their problem solving, all while 
learning about the various subjects of study listed above. </p>
</div>

## Mechanics (Overview)

<div>
<p> 
Players will spawn into a level where they must find a path to the exit. The player will have access to two unique playable characters within each level. 
Using those characters they must work together and establish a path to the exit using resources found within the level. 
Each unique character will have a value assigned to them, which will give them access to certain parts of the level. 
In the math levels each unique character will be assigned a numeric value ex. 4, 8, -3, while for science the unique characters will be assigned elements 
ex. Mg, Na, C. In order to complete the level the player must control the two unique characters, and use each of their unique values to access 
different parts of the level. 
</p>
</div>

## Gameplay/Core Interactions

<div>
<p> 
Players will collect items within the level that will change the value of the unique playable character. 
They must make their way around the level collecting the appropriate items in order change the character 
to the appropriate value, in order to the to progress through each level. For example the player might 
collect a +4 item that will change one of the unique characters value from 4 to 8. With a new value of 8, 
this unique character will now be able to access the door labeled 8. Each playable character will be assigned 
a qualitative or quantitive value that is unique to their character, so using problem solving players 
must establish a path around the level based around each unique character they are playing with. 
Using the above example, the unique character with the value of 8, now has access to the door labeled 8, 
the character can now enter that room and press a button that will open up another door, allowing a different 
unique character to access a certain part of the level. 
</p>

<p>

Gameplay is primarily focused on platforming and and being creative in your problem solving. 
Players must traverse each level by jumping on platforms and collecting certain items that will open up door ways, 
different paths, and give your character certain abilities. All levels will will be focused on a certain subject, 
like math for example, where the player must use basic adding, subtracting, division, and multiplication in order to 
traverse the level and eventually completing it. Science levels will focus on combining and creating elements within the 
levels, and using new element values to pass through certain sections of the level.
